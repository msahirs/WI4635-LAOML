# WI4635-LAOML
Repository containing code for the assignments in the course WI4635 - Linear Algebra and Optimisation for Machine Learning - at TU Delft

## Directory Guide
- Project description under `/assets`
- IRIS - and other - datasets under `/data`
- All code and routines under `/src`

## Notes
- All code written in **Python**
- Only basic Linear Algebra libs, so *Numpy* and *Scipy*, allowed. Maybe other plotting libraries for data visualisation, i.e. *Matplotlib* or *Plotly*
- We gotta be super explicit about everything we do. Like on performance, stability, convergence progression, expectations, etc.
- Report is informal! :D
